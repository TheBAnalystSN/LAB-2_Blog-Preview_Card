What accessibility challenges did you face, and how did you address them?
I ensured proper color contrast ratios using HSL values and added descriptive alt text to images. I also used keyboard-focusable links with visible hover/focus states.

How did you ensure that your design was responsive and accessible to all users?
I used a mobile-first approach with flexible widths and scalable font sizes, ensuring the card adapts across devices. All text elements maintain readable color contrast and spacing.

What tools or resources did you find most helpful during this project?
Figma for design reference, WebAIM Color Contrast Checker, and Frontend Mentorâ€™s style guide were essential for maintaining accuracy and accessibility.
